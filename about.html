<p>Calvary Chapel Community Church is a member of the Calvary Chapel group of churches. 
We are based in the heart of Cape Town, South Africa, and have been ministering in our city since 1999.</p>

<h2 class="product-name">Small beginnings</h2>
<p>
While there are well over a thousand Calvary Chapels around the world today, 
Calvary Chapel started out in America in 1965 as a single congregation of 25 
members in Costa Mesa, California. On the verge of closing down their ailing 
church, the Lord encouraged them with a prophetic word that He would bless 
their church, that it would become overcrowded, and that it would become 
known throughout the world. Although this all seemed highly unlikely at the 
time, God sent a sweeping revival in the late 1960’s that led to thousands 
of conversions, baptisms, and the growth of Calvary Chapel.

<blockquote>When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord - Acts 11:23.</blockquote>
